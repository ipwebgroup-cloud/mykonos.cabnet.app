# MYKONOS_PLUGIN_HANDOFF.md

## Project
Mykonos Cabnet OctoberCMS inquiry project

## Active root
- `mykonos.cabnet.app`

## Active plugin
- `plugins/cabnet/mykonosinquiry`

## Continuity status
This file is continuity-critical.

In any new chat:
1. inspect the latest uploaded rooted project archive / latest rooted patch zip first
2. inspect this file second
3. use the GitHub repo only as a secondary comparison reference
4. if older notes conflict with the real uploaded files, prefer the real uploaded files

Repo reference:
- `https://github.com/ipwebgroup-cloud/mykonos.cabnet.app`

---

## Core operating rule
Treat the latest real uploaded rooted project state as the source of truth.

Do **not** restart from older patch notes alone.
Do **not** rewind to older v2.x assumptions unless the uploaded files clearly show that state.
Do **not** invent new architecture that is not present in the real files.

---

## Stable project direction
This is a real OctoberCMS inquiry platform, not just a theme.

Stable direction:
- public luxury frontend
- mobile-first `/plan` inquiry flow
- DB-backed inquiry persistence through the plugin
- backend inquiry queue and operator workflow
- guarded Loyalty Continuity Workspace
- safe plugin/theme integration
- safe incremental development without breaking live operations

---

## Public flow guardrail
The `/plan` flow must remain on the plugin-backed bridge direction established from the v41 integration line.

That means:
- `/plan` saves through the plugin, not a theme-only email handler
- email continuity to `mykonos@cabnet.app` remains part of the public process
- do **not** introduce a separate theme-only internal inquiry system
- do **not** casually modify the public flow unless the real uploaded files clearly require a public fix

---

## Live operational workspace
- **Inquiry Queue**

This remains the live operational workspace and must stay stable first.

Preserve first:
- backend inquiry list
- backend inquiry update/detail screen
- loyalty continuity workspace rendering
- `/plan` public bridge
- October backend/editor rendering

---

## Current development line
The current long-running line remains the guarded:

- **Loyalty Continuity Workspace**

But the immediate operational priority is now explicit:
- the loyalty workspace is now schema-ready and rendering its live list view
- the immediate issue shifted from storage activation to controller-added create-form partial safety
- the next real production-safe move is a **controller-added create-form partial hotfix**, not more loyalty readability expansion

---

## Latest applied patch line
Latest known rooted patch prepared for deployment:

- `v6.39.4 loyalty create-form controller partial render-safe hotfix patch`
- plugin tracking `2.3.56`

This patch does not change schema and does not touch `/plan`.
It makes the loyalty create form render-safe by preventing controller-added overview/workspace/history partials from being injected during create context and by hardening the known failing close-handoff and finish-handback partials to tolerate create-form context if they are ever rendered again.

---

## Deployment note
For this patch, upload the rooted files and then run:

- `php artisan cache:clear`

Then verify:

- Backend -> Mykonos Inquiries -> Loyalty Continuity
- click `New Loyalty Record`
- confirm the create form opens instead of crashing
- confirm the close-handoff / finish-handback overview callouts no longer break create mode
- `php scripts/qa-loyalty-workspace-activation.php`

Do **not** treat `plugin:refresh Cabnet.MykonosInquiry` as the default first production step for this line.
The sync migration was added specifically to avoid a destructive rebuild-first posture on a live inquiry plugin.

---

## Root continuity companion file
Keep both files updated together:
- `MYKONOS_PLUGIN_HANDOFF.md`
- `MYKONOS_CONTINUE_PROMPT.md`

---

## Deployment requirement
Every deployment patch zip must preserve the rooted structure.

The user extracts from:
- `/home/cabnet/public_html/`

So patch zips must place files under:
- `mykonos.cabnet.app/...`
