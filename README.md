# Mykonos Cabnet OctoberCMS Inquiry Platform

Private project repository for the live **Mykonos Cabnet inquiry platform** built on **OctoberCMS**, with a plugin-backed luxury inquiry workflow and operator-focused backend handling.

## Project purpose

This repository tracks the production-safe source for:
- luxury public frontend
- mobile-first `/plan` inquiry flow
- DB-backed persistence through `Cabnet.MykonosInquiry`
- backend inquiry queue and operator workflow
- safe incremental plugin/theme integration

## Current active line

### Theme

### Plugin

- Public bridge component: `mykonosPlanBridge`

## Stable workflow direction

The working production line preserves:
- `/plan` submission through `mykonosPlanBridge::onSubmitInquiry`
- inquiry persistence into `cabnet_mykonos_inquiries`
- backend inquiry list and detail handling
- generated request reference shown after successful submit
- safe email notification handling
- operator workflow actions, notes, and continuity improvements
