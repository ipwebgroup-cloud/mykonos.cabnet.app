# Mykonos Cabnet OctoberCMS Inquiry Platform

Private project repository for the live **Mykonos Cabnet inquiry platform** built on **OctoberCMS**, with a plugin-backed luxury inquiry workflow and operator-focused backend handling.

## Project purpose

This repository tracks the production-safe source for:
- luxury public frontend
- mobile-first `/plan` inquiry flow
- DB-backed persistence through `Cabnet.MykonosInquiry`
- backend inquiry queue and operator workflow
- guarded loyalty continuity workspace
- dedicated workspace docs/help route
- safe incremental plugin/theme integration

## Current active line

### Theme
- Active live theme directory: `themes/mykonos-aurelia-lux`
- Branding/content line: **Mykonos Nocturne Luxe**

### Plugin
- Plugin: `plugins/cabnet/mykonosinquiry`
- Backend label: **Mykonos Inquiries**
- Public bridge component: `mykonosPlanBridge`

## Stable workflow direction

The working production line preserves:
- `/plan` submission through `mykonosPlanBridge::onSubmitInquiry`
- inquiry persistence into `cabnet_mykonos_inquiries`
- backend inquiry list and detail handling
- generated request reference shown after successful submit
- safe email notification handling
- operator workflow actions, notes, and continuity improvements
- Loyalty Continuity as the guarded repeat-guest / retention workspace
- Workspace Docs as the centralized help surface

## Current continuity checkpoint

### v6.41.69 — Shared List Toolbar Layout Consistency Patch
Included in the current stable backend polish line:
- queue toolbar wrapping and helper-note fixes
- inquiry queue filter wrap polish
- shared queue / loyalty top-row layout consistency
- plugin tracking continues from the verified `2.4.23` loyalty workspace line
