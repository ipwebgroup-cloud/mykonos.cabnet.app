# Mykonos Cabnet OctoberCMS Inquiry Platform

Private project repository for the live **Mykonos Cabnet inquiry platform** built on **OctoberCMS**, with a plugin-backed luxury inquiry workflow and operator-focused backend handling.

## Project purpose

This repository tracks the production-safe source for:
- luxury public frontend
- mobile-first `/plan` inquiry flow
- DB-backed persistence through `Cabnet.MykonosInquiry`
- backend inquiry queue and operator workflow
- loyalty continuity workspace
- workspace docs/help routing
- safe incremental plugin/theme integration

## Current active line

### Theme
- Active live theme directory: `themes/mykonos-aurelia-lux`
- Branding/content line: **Mykonos Nocturne Luxe**

### Plugin
- Plugin: `plugins/cabnet/mykonosinquiry`
- Backend label: **Mykonos Inquiries**
- Public bridge component: `mykonosPlanBridge`

## Live operational workspace

The current backend workspace is centered on:
- **Inquiry Queue**
- **Loyalty Continuity**
- **Workspace Docs**

## Stable workflow direction

The working production line preserves:
- `/plan` submission through `mykonosPlanBridge::onSubmitInquiry`
- inquiry persistence into `cabnet_mykonos_inquiries`
- backend inquiry list and detail handling
- generated request reference shown after successful submit
- safe email notification handling
- operator workflow actions, notes, and continuity improvements
- guarded loyalty continuity follow-through from the inquiry queue

## Current stable continuity hint

Included in the current safe backend polish line:
- queue toolbar wrapping hardening
- helper note block isolation on its own row
- safer note text wrapping beside the search area
